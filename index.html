</h1>Hello World<h1>
</p> HTMl stands for hyper text markup language. HTML is the standard text maarkup for many websites you see everyday. Not only does HTML structure the web design it also tells the browser how to display the content.<br>
</p> I decided to take this class because I would like to learn more about degining websites, and how they are designed. Not only the deisgn that your looking at on your screen but also what is going on behind the scenes. Not only may I aquire some new skills, I hope to enjoy the process along the way.
